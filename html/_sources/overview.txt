Overview
========

xcheck is used to validate xml in Python. No other code is required.

xcheck can:

* use different rules to determine the content of xml elements
* validate ordered and unordered elements
* xcheck objects are callable, and can check:
        * real data
        * strings that represent real data
        * ElementTree.Element objects
        * Text representing an ElementTree.Element object

Currently, :class:`xcheck` objects do not deal with namespace issues.
